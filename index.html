    <h1>Bre's Coding Camp</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a page to allow Bre to learn how to code (hopefully). 
        <br> These are the reasons this might be a good idea: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It would be really cool to have this new skill</li>
            <li>She will have more in common with her hubby</li>
            <li>She will finally know what hubby is talking about (sort of)</li>
            <li>There will be more job opportunities</li>
        </ul>
